The programs in the package were originally written by Jean Chung with
the exception of convolute (written by Thomas Proffen). While the
calculation has remained the same the output files (from allppdf) have
been altered to work with kuplot while the input method for allsig has
been changed to allow for easier batch processing.

======================================================================

allsig and allppdf are programs that use the Kirkwood potential model
to calculate partial pdfs for Zinc-Blende (ZnS) crystals for ternary
alloys. This is done by minimizing the energy of the system and
solving the dynamical matrix. The process is done in four steps:

1) allsig static - minimize the energy using static displacements

2) allsig eigen - find the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix

3) allsig thermal - find the peak width distributions for a given
temperature

4) allppdf - calculate the neutron or x-ray pdf, rdf, differential
rdf, or partial rdf. This step can combine several allsig thermal
calculations. The pdfs can (in principle) be convoluted with a sinc
function to account for a finite measurement range using
convolute. However, this should only be done on the pdf and not any of
the rdfs.

An alternative to calculating the pdfs is to calculate the length
distributions. This is done with the program lendis.
